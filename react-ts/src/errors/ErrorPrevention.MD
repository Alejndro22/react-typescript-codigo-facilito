# How to prevent errors during coding

1. Take advantage of my code editor features

- Here in VSCode, next to terminal there's a tab about Problems on my file

2. Read Typescript description about my errors

3. Everytime I found IntrinsicAttributes, it means that i'm passing props that weren't found on my component

4. When bundle is created (build script), if an errow wasn't handled thanks to my tsconfig the error will appear. So a good idea could be to run this script before pushing to my git repo.
